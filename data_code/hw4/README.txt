Q1:

MEDV = -0.1084 * CRIM + 0.0458 * ZN + 2.7187 * CHAS=1 - 17.376 * NOX + 3.8016 * RM - 1.4927 * DIS + 0.2996 * RAD - 0.0118 * TAX - 0.9465 * PTRATIO + 0.0093 * B - 0.5226 * LSTAT + 36.3411

There are in total 12 terms including the constant term.

The equation describes the linear relationship between a set of independent variables including CRIM, ZN, CHAS=1, NOX, RM, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT and dependent variable MEDV. 

The Coefficient of each independent variable represents its weight towards dependent varible MEDV. 

The constant term 36.3411 is the y-intercept of the line. 

The attribute INDUS, AGE and CHAS=0 are missing in the equation because they do not play important roles in the linear relationship here or they are unrelated to the output variable MEDV.
