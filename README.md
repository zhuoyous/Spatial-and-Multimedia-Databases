## 📁 Folder Overview

### `hw1/` — **Intro to Spatial Concepts**
- `HW1.png`: Diagram or output related to basic spatial concepts.
- `README.txt`: Overview of the task.

> **Focus:** Foundational spatial reasoning or coordinate plotting.

---

### `hw2/` — **Spatial SQL Queries**
- `Q1.sql` to `Q5_V3.sql`: SQL queries covering spatial operations like containment, distance, and intersection.

> **Focus:** Writing and refining spatial queries using SQL on a spatial database system (Oracle Spatial or PostGIS).

---

### `hw3/` — **GIS Data Processing and Visualization**
- `point creation.py`: Python script to generate spatial points.
- Shapefiles: (`.shp`, `.dbf`, `.shx`, `.prj`, `.cpg`) for both `spiro-line` and `spiro-point`.
- `spiro.kml`, `starter_kml.kml`: Google Earth-compatible files for spatial visualization.
- `.txt` files: Raw spatial data inputs (coordinates, locations).
- `.PNG`: Screenshots of spatial outputs or visual query results.

> **Focus:** Creating and visualizing spatial datasets using Python, shapefiles, and KML in GIS tools.

---

### `hw4/` — **Spatial/Multimedia Query Visualizations**
- `Q1.PNG`, `Q2.PNG`, `Q3.PNG`: Screenshots of query outputs.
- `README.txt`: Describes each query and its visualization.

> **Focus:** Interpreting and presenting query results visually, likely using GIS or image analysis tools.

---

### `hw5/` — **Multimedia Data Processing with CNN**
- `Q1/weights.h5`: Trained model weights (Keras/TensorFlow).
- `Q2/`, `Q3/`: Input images and classification result screenshots (`.PNG`, `.JPG`).

> **Focus:** Applying convolutional neural networks for object recognition on image datasets.

---

## ✅ Technologies & Tools Used
